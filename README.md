#A project with Stack data structure implementation

The stack data structure is similar in concept to a physical stack of objects. When you add an item to a stack, you place it on top of the stack. When you remove an item from a stack, you always remove the top-most item. Stacks are useful and also exceedingly simple. The main goal of building a stack is to enforce how you access your data.
